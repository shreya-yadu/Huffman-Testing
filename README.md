# Huffman-Testing
# In this program code there are a number of source code files, all them have been listed
# 1. Huffman.java - This source code takes care of all the heaps and encodes, decodes it.
# 2. PairingHeap.java – This source code takes cares of pairing heap and executes the Huffman algorithm.
# 3. Binaryheap – This source code takes care of binary heap i.e 2 way heap, executes the Huffman algorithm as well.
# 4. Fourwayheap - This source code takes care of Four way heap, executes the Huffman algorithm as well.
# 5. Encoder - This source code takes care of all the static encoder methods that are being called from the Huffman class.
# 6. Decoder - This source code takes care of all the static decoder methods that are being called from the Huffman class.
